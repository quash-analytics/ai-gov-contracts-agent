"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the memory bake-off's scorer, and its fixture.

The arena's whole claim is that its numbers are measured rather than felt, so
the scorer has to be the least mysterious code in the repo: pure functions over
strings, graded here with no model, no keys and no network.

The distinction these tests exist to protect is STALE vs MISS. On a boolean
scorer both are "fail", which throws away the only interesting finding: a
system that says "I don't know" is behaving correctly under uncertainty, and a
system that confidently repeats last month's answer is dangerous. Collapse them
and the video has nothing to report.

INVENTED is the headline number — a refusal was correct and the system answered
anyway — so it gets the most cases, including the one that matters commercially:
a legal probe where the deadline was never given.
