"""`python -m jarvis brief` — a morning briefing that runs through the normal
harness (so it traces and animates like any turn), composing your real calendar,
mail, and memory into a focus-first summary. Cron it for a daily greeting:

    30 7 * * *  cd ~/jarvis-agent && make brief

The heavy lifting lives in skills/weekly-brief/SKILL.md — this just kicks off
the turn and saves the result to the outbox.
