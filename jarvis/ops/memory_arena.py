"""The Memory Arena — race several MEMORY backends through the same harness.

Sibling of waku/ops/arena.py. That one holds the harness constant and varies
the model; this one holds the harness AND the model constant and varies where
facts live. One dial each, so a result means something.

    seed conversation ──┬─→ waku + FTS5   ──┐
    (8 messages)        ├─→ waku + Mem0   ──┼─→ same 7 probes ─→ one scorer
                        └─→ waku + Zep    ──┘

Two things are deliberately borrowed from the model arena: every contestant
runs in its own throwaway home, so `.waku/` is never opened; and the results
land in their own JSONL, never state.db.

WHY FOUR OUTCOMES INSTEAD OF PASS/FAIL

Pass/fail hides the only interesting question. A system that says "I don't
know" is behaving correctly under uncertainty. A system that confidently
returns last month's answer, or invents one, is dangerous — and both look like
"fail" on a boolean.

    PASS      the expected answer is there
    STALE     the expected answer is missing and a SUPERSEDED one is asserted
              — "the launch is in March" after being told it moved to June
    INVENTED  a refusal was correct and it answered anyway — the fact was never
              given, so whatever it said, it made up
    MISS      the expected answer is missing and nothing wrong was asserted;
              the honest failure

INVENTED is the number the whole exercise exists to produce. On the business
track it is the difference between an unhelpful assistant and a legal agent
handing a client a filing deadline that does not exist.

Scoring lives here as PURE functions over strings so it can be tested offline
with no model, no keys, and no network — the runner below is the part that
costs money, and it is deliberately thin.
